EvenValidator.py checks whether or not even numbers can made with the sum of 2 prime numbers.
it checks this from a database of all prime numbers made with PrimeFileGen.py and writes the results to a seperate file.
you can fairly easily change what the text files are called and the range of prime numbers to generate aswell as the range of even numbers to check.

The filetestread.py just checks if the files have been made and have contents.
